                <p>Vibed began as a simple idea among friends who struggled to find compatible roommates while moving to new cities. What started as casual conversations about mismatched living situations turned into a mission to make shared housing more human and stress-free.
                  In 2023, the Vibed team started building a platform that blends technology with trust — combining smart roommate matching, verified listings, and in-app communication. By 2025, Vibed evolved into a growing community that connects people through shared spaces and genuine compatibility, redefining how modern co-living should feel.</p>
